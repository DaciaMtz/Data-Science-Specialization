## Next Word Predictor

*Predictive Text for Enhanced User Experience*

**Around the World:**
- People are spending more time on mobile devices for activities like social networking, banking, and emails.

**The Problem:**
- Typing on mobile devices can be frustrating and time-consuming.

**The Solution:**
- Predictive text models, like those used by SwiftKey, make typing faster and easier. For example:
  - When someone types: *"I went to the"*
  - Predictions might include: *gym, store, restaurant.*

**Our Mission:**
- Build a smart predictive text tool to enhance user experience on any device.


## How Our Predictive Model Works

Our predictive text model uses **n-gram probabilities** and a **backoff strategy** to suggest the next word based on user input. 

1. **Analyze Input:** The model splits the input text into individual words (tokens).
2. **Check for Patterns:** It searches for matching patterns in:
   - **4-grams:** Uses the last three words to predict the next.
   - **3-grams:** If no match, uses the last two words.
   - **2-grams:** If still no match, uses the last word.
   - **1-gram:** Always includes the most frequent single words as a fallback.
3. **Combine Predictions:** Results from all levels are ranked by probability, and the top three suggestions are shown.
4. **Why It Works:** This approach ensures fast, accurate predictions while always offering a suggestion, even with minimal input.
  

## How the Product Works

1. **Enter a phrase**: Type a partial sentence in the input box.
2. **Click 'Predict Next Word'**: The app will show you the top 3 predictions.
