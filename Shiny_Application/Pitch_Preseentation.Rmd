## Introduction
Our idea is to build an application that predicts outcomes using advanced models. 

## Problem Statement
**The problem**: Users struggle to find intuitive tools for prediction and analysis.

**The solution**: A Shiny app that provides easy-to-use, real-time predictions.

## Our Approach

In this example we are predicting Petal Length from Sepal Length using the IRIS dataset
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, xlab = "Sepal Length", ylab = "Petal Length", pch = 16, col = "lightblue", main = "Prediction of Petal Length Based on Sepal Length")

```
